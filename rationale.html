                        The advent of high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations in solar physics have revealed an intricate multi-scale and multi-layer interaction in the solar atmosphere, in which small changes in the magnetic topology can lead to abrupt, large-scale disruption affecting the Sun on a global scale. In turn, sun-as-a-star integrated observations provide essential pathways to elucidate stellar observations, stellar evolution and the impact on a star’s environment. The multiplex advantage of many stars combined with the higher temporal and spectral resolution in the stellar field can be major drivers of solar research. Moreover, solar and stellar observations are now at a stage where large-scale magnetic fields can be compared. However, both communities traditionally evolve largely independently, often using conflicting terminologies (e.g. due to the difference in scales) instead of seeking synergies for the benefit of both.
On the solar side, missions such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and HINODE have been the major drivers of solar research over the last decade. These roles are being complemented by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, which through their in-situ and high resolution imaging at multiple viewpoints are bringing exciting new results that are shifting decade-old viewpoints on the biggest solar and stellar physics problems. The origin of the small-scale field of the quiet Sun/stars remains a matter of hot debate between local and global dynamo theories. Similarly, it is unclear how the energy of the small-scale field is transported across the chromosphere-corona transition region. Nevertheless, p-modes have been found to leave their distinctive signatures in the solar corona, potentially providing a basal heating source. Small magnetic flux cancellation events have been observed to lead to solar eruptions. The observed multi-scale occurrence of the energy release either through reconnection or through MHD waves is clearly reflected in the pico, nano, micro and large-scale jets observed throughout the solar atmosphere, heating the corona and accelerating the solar wind. Atmospheric heating is often accompanied by a measured cooling response, manifesting through thermal non-equilibrium cycles and the highly structured coronal rain and prominences, now invoked to explain the complex spectral line profiles observed in flaring stars and also as possible major contributors to stellar winds. Despite the enhanced flaring activity of active stars compared to the Sun, there are still no unambiguous detections of stellar CMEs, which may be indicative of other processes or regimes at play in the stellar domain compared to the solar paradigm. Overall, the heating and cooling processes govern solar and stellar variability and need to be discussed together to nurture necessary insights for tracing similar phenomena on stars and help clear the path toward detectability signals and bias.
 The solar field is rapidly evolving, now with the successful launch of ADITYA and the first results from CHASE, ASO-S, PROBA, among others. New DKIST data is finally becoming available, which will likely shift the focus to ground-based instrumentation as a major research driver. This is being supplemented with major upgrades from GREGOR, SST, NST and NVST. At the same time, large expectations are building regarding the next generation MUSE, EUVST, EST and the new cubesat proposals, e.g. PADRE, that offers a strong change in the way data is acquired and science is made.
On the stellar side, observations are reaching the point of solar comparison, in some cases with higher temporal and in particular spectral resolution. Missions such as Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) give us unprecedented information about the brightness variation of stars where we could reach a valuable understanding of stellar interiors and evolution. Over the past two decades there has been a substantial improvement in techniques of spectro-polarimetric stellar observations, such as Zeeman broadening (ZB) and Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI). The advent of state-of-the-art spectropolarimetric instruments, integrated with mid- and large-sized telescopes, has revolutionized our exploration of large-scale magnetic fields. The future is promising for stellar observations, the upcoming of high resolution instruments such as the ANDES spectrograph at the The Extremely Large Telescope (39 m, E-ELT), or the G-CLEF instrument at the Giant Magellan Telescope (25.4 m, GMT). These observations have and will best provide unprecedented insights into the intricate interplay between magnetic fields and matter, including their impact on atmospheres, star-planet interactions, rotational dynamics, and the shedding of mass through stellar winds that is essential for angular momentum loss.
On the numerical side, multiple `Star-in-a-box’ global 3D MHD codes are now available, with new techniques that allow to more efficiently treat the transfer of energy through the many scales of the solar atmosphere. Extensions of the theory into partial ionisation and kinetic physics with new multi-fluid and kinetic codes that couple with MHD are shedding light into the coupling between local and global physical processes. New codes are becoming available, able to seamlessly integrate the multi-scale variation and widely disparate physical domains that govern the plasma dynamics from the solar/stellar sources to the helio/asterospheric environment.
In this new era of big data, best exemplified by the order of magnitude increase in data generation from DKIST to E-ELT, machine learning is becoming an essential method, not only for automatic feature detection or triggering mechanism for data acquisition, but also to develop physics-informed algorithms that help to tackle numerically challenging problems.

Advancing in the understanding of our star and its effects on Earth requires a considerable coordinated effort of observers, theorists and numerical modellers. Knowledge exchange across the solar and stellar communities can accelerate these achievements. In the wake of PSP, SolO, Aditya, the advent of DKIST and JWST, as well as, for the next generation space-based and ground-based instrumentation, an IAU Symposium is perfectly timed in 2025 to consolidate our understanding and define the next future challenges. The Symposium will provide a forum for

discussion of the recent advances, identifying synergies and a platform for developing new coordinated observing and theoretical programs. This Symposium will be of great interest also for the IAU Divisions studying stellar atmospheres, starspots, exoplanetary systems, and developing cutting-edge observational techniques and theoretical models to explore the complex processes occurring within stars, and investigating their magnetic activity, surface features, and evolutionary paths. Techniques such as Helio and Asteroseismology generate the best possible information from the interiors of stars. Helioseismology is widely used in the solar community and renders a closer connection to the stellar field in order to understand the generation of large and small-scale phenomena from their possible origin in the stellar interior.
